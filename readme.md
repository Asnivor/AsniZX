## AsniZX - ZX Spectrum Emulation

AsniZX is a work-in-progress attempt at writing my first emulator. Until there is actually a release, stay well away :)

It is currently taking inspiration from (and in some cases using code from) the following:

* Spectnetide - https://github.com/Dotneteer/spectnetide/
* BizHawk - https://github.com/TASVideos/BizHawk
* Zero - https://github.com/ArjunNair/Zero-Emulator/
* ZX Spin - https://sites.google.com/site/pauldunn/ZXSpin_Source_Luca.zip

And during my slow, ardious learning process I have been crying whilst looking at the following resources:
